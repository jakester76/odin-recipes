    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe covers the art of making scrambled eggs. It's not too hard, but will definitely improve the more you make them. Timing the cooking portion can be especially difficult and requires actively monitoring and stirring.</p>
    <p>There's not necessary a right and a wrong level of "done-ness", but you'll find that there are ways that you enjoy them more than others. Some people prefer more "runny" while some prefer more well done. It's up to you and whoever you're cooking for.</p>
    <p>You'll likely want to make these in a skillet or pan on the stovetop or range, but you could also resort to making these in a microwave.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Fluffing Liquid - Chef's choice. Some prefer Heavy cream, milk or water. Generally you want to add something, otherwise the finished product is heavier/more dense.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack eggs into a bowl. A good rule of thumb is about 2 large eggs per person. Cracking them ahead of time, helps make the rest of the process go smooth and you can eliminate or remove shells easier.</li>
        <li>Add a splash or two of Fluffing Liquid to Eggs</li>
        <li>Whisk combination together until some bubbles some bubbles form.</li>
        <li>Melt some butter in a pan on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Give the egg mixture another quick whisk to make sure it hasn't settled or separated.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into pan before butten starts to brown.</li>
        <li>As eggs begin to solify around the edges and along the bottom of the pan, use a spatula to remove and stir a little. Allowing the liquid egg to recoat the pan, and repeat this process every few seconds</li>
        <li>Eventually there will be no more liquid egg mixture to coat the pan. This is usually when I break up some of the large pieces of egg, if any, into more managable bite sizes and cook a little longer. What were looking for here is to remove excess liquid, but not completely dry out the egg.</li>
        <li>Once they're to your likely, plate, allow a moment to cool and enjoy with seasonings of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
