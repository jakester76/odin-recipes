        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place pizza stone on middle rack in oven.</li>
            <li>Prehead oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a thin dusting of flour over a work area. This is where you'll roll the dough.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough into your desired shape.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle another thin dusting of corn meal onto pizza peel.</li>
            <li>Move dough onto pizza peel. You'll assemble the pizza while it's on the peel. It's much easier this way.</li>
            <li>Add sauce in a thin layer across dough, leaving space around the edge for the crust.</li>
            <li>Add toppings. Space as desired.</li>
            <li>Add cheese</li>
            <li>Before attempting to slide the pizza from the peel onto the stone in the hot oven, take the peel handle and swivel the from side to side, rotating around the pizza. This should allow the pizza to start to slide atop of the corn meal. Once the pizza shimmies a little, you'll know it'll slide onto the stone much easier - avoiding a smokey mess in the hot oven.</li>
            <li>Bake for 5 minutes or until cheese starts to bubble.</li>
            <li>Open oven, and rub a stick of butter around the crust. You could also remove the pizza for this step, and add any desired crust seasonings.</li>
            <li>Bake for another minute.</li>
            <li>Remove pizza before crust burns and allow to sit for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
